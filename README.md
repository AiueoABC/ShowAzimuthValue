# ShowAzimuthValue
In this example, Android will calculate Rotation from accelerometer and magnetometer values.  
This will be useful if your android doesn't have gyrosensor.  

If you want to rewrite it to use gyro sensor in case youyr phone has it, change lines from ln23 to ln36 of `MainActivity.kt`
